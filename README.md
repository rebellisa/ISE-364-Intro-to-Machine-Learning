# ISE-364-Intro-to-Machine-Learning

This is a class project that I did when I took ISE 364 in 2019 Fall semester with Prof. Louis Plebani. The data that we use is the Census Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains anonymous information such as age, occupation, education, working class, etc. The goal of the project is to train a binary classifier to predict the income which has two possible values ‘>50K’ and ‘<50K’. There are 48842 instances and 14 attributes in the dataset. The data contains a good blend of categorical, numerical and missing values.
